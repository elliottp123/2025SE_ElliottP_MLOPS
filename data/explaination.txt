ABSTRACT
Although the educational level of the Portuguese population has improved in the last decades, the statistics
keep Portugal at Europe’s tail end due to its high student failure rates. In particular, lack of success in the
core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the
fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM),
which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw
data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the
education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g.
student grades, demographic, social and school related
features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and
Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input
selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were
tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy
can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second
school period grades are available. Although student
achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an
explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other
relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job
and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction
tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.
INTRODUCTION
Education is a key factor for achieving a long-term economic progress. During the last decades, the Portuguese
educational level has improved. However, the statistics
keep the Portugal at Europe’s tail end due to its high
student failure and dropping out rates. For example, in
2006 the early school leaving rate in Portugal was 40%
for 18 to 24 year olds, while the European Union average
value was just 15% (Eurostat 2007). In particular, failure in the core classes of Mathematics and Portuguese
(the native language) is extremely serious, since they
provide fundamental knowledge for the success in the
remaining school subjects (e.g. physics or history).
On the other hand, the interest in Business Intelligence
(BI)/Data Mining (DM) (Turban et al. 2007), arose due
to the advances of Information Technology, leading to
an exponential growth of business and organizational
databases. All this data holds valuable information,
such as trends and patterns, which can be used to improve decision making and optimize success. Yet, human experts are limited and may overlook important
details. Hence, the alternative is to use automated tools
to analyze the raw data and extract interesting highlevel information for the decision-maker.
The education arena offers a fertile ground for BI applications, since there are multiple sources of data (e.g.
traditional databases, online web pages) and diverse interest groups (e.g. students, teachers, administrators or
alumni) (Ma et al. 2000). For instance, there are several interesting questions for this domain that could be
answered using BI/DM techniques (Luan 2002, MinaeiBidgoli et al. 2003): Who are the students taking most
credit hours? Who is likely to return for more classes?
What type of courses can be offered to attract more students? What are the main reasons for student transfers?
Is is possible to predict student performance? What are
the factors that affect student achievement? This paper
will focus in the last two questions. Modeling student
performance is an important tool for both educators and
students, since it can help a better understanding of this
phenomenon and ultimately improve it. For instance,
school professionals could perform corrective measures
for weak students (e.g. remedial classes).
In effect, several studies have addressed similar topics.
Ma et al. (2000) applied a DM approach based in Association Rules in order to select weak tertiary school
students of Singapore for remedial classes. The input
variables included demographic attributes (e.g. sex, region) and school performance over the past years and
the proposed solution outperformed the traditional allocation procedure. In 2003 (Minaei-Bidgoli et al. 2003),
online student grades from the Michigan State University were modeled using three classification approaches
(i.e. binary: pass/fail; 3-level: low, middle, high; and
9-level: from 1 - lowest grade to 9 - highest score). The
database included 227 samples with online features (e.g.
number of corrected answers or tries for homework) and
the best results were obtained by a classifier ensemble
(e.g. Decision Tree and Neural Network) with accuracy rates of 94% (binary), 72% (3-classes) and 62% (9-
classes). Kotsiantis et al. (2004) applied several DM algorithms to predict the performance of computer science
students from an university distance learning program.
For each student, several demographic (e.g. sex, age,
marital status) and performance attributes (e.g. mark
in a given assignment) were used as inputs of a binary
pass/fail classifier. The best solution was obtained by a
Naive Bayes method with an accuracy of 74%. Also, it
was found that past school grades have a much higher
impact than demographic variables. More recently, Pardos et al. (2006) collected data from an online tutoring
system regarding USA 8th grade Math tests. The authors adopted a regression approach, where the aim was
to predict the math test score based on individual skills.
The authors used Bayesian Networks and the best result
was an predictive error of 15%.
In this work, we will analyze recent real-world data
from two Portuguese secondary schools. Two different sources were used: mark reports and questionnaires.
Since the former contained scarce information (i.e. only
the grades and number of absences were available), it
was complemented with the latter, which allowed the
collection of several demographic, social and school related attributes (e.g. student’s age, alcohol consumption, mother’s education). The aim is to predict student
achievement and if possible to identify the key variables
that affect educational success/failure. The two core
classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) will be modeled under three DM goals:
i) binary classification (pass/fail);
ii) classification with five levels (from I very good or
excellent to V - insufficient); and
iii) regression, with a numeric output that ranges between zero (0%) and twenty (100%).
For each of these approaches, three input setups (e.g.
with and without the school period grades) and four
DM algorithms (e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forest)
will be tested. Moreover, an explanatory analysis will
be performed over the best models, in order to identify
the most relevant features.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Student Data
In Portugal, the secondary education consists of 3 years
of schooling, preceding 9 years of basic education and
followed by higher education. Most of the students join
the public and free education system. There are several
courses (e.g. Sciences and Technologies, Visual Arts)
that share core subjects such as the Portuguese Language and Mathematics. Like several other countries
(e.g. France or Venezuela), a 20-point grading scale is
used, where 0 is the lowest grade and 20 is the perfect
score. During the school year, students are evaluated
in three periods and the last evaluation (G3 of Table 1)
corresponds to the final grade.
This study will consider data collected during the 2005-
2006 school year from two public schools, from the Alentejo region of Portugal. Although there has been a trend
for an increase of Information Technology investment
from the Government, the majority of the Portuguese
public school information systems are very poor, relying mostly on paper sheets (which was the current case).
Hence, the database was built from two sources: school
reports, based on paper sheets and including few attributes (i.e. the three period grades and number of
school absences); and questionnaires, used to complement the previous information. We designed the latter
with closed questions (i.e. with predefined options) related to several demographic (e.g. mother’s education,
family income), social/emotional (e.g. alcohol consumption) (Pritchard and Wilson 2003) and school related
(e.g. number of past class failures) variables that were
expected to affect student performance. The questionnaire was reviewed by school professionals and tested on
a small set of 15 students in order to get a feedback. The
final version contained 37 questions in a single A4 sheet
and it was answered in class by 788 students. Latter,
111 answers were discarded due to lack of identification
details (necessary for merging with the school reports).
Finally, the data was integrated into two datasets related to Mathematics (with 395 examples) and the Portuguese language (649 records) classes.
During the preprocessing stage, some features were discarded due to the lack of discriminative value. For instance, few respondents answered about their family
income (probably due to privacy issues), while almost
100% of the students live with their parents and have a
personal computer at home. The remaining attributes
are shown in Table 1, where the last four rows denote
the variables taken from the school reports.
Data Mining Models
Classification and regression are two important DM
goals. Both require a supervised learning, where a model
is adjusted to a dataset made up of k ∈ {1, ..., N} examples, each mapping an input vector (x
k
1
, . . . , xk
I
) to
a given target yk. The main difference is set in terms
of the output representation, (i.e. discrete for classification and continuous for regression). In classification,
models are often evaluated using the Percentage of Correct Classifications (PCC), while in regression the Root

Mean Squared (RMSE) is a popular metric (Witten and
Frank 2005). A high PCC (i.e. near 100%) suggests a
good classifier, while a regressor should present a low
global error (i.e. RMSE close to zero). These metrics
can be computed using the equations:
Φ(i) = 
1 , if yi = ybi
0 , else
P CC =
PN
i=1 Φ(i)/N × 100 (%)
RMSE =
qPN
i=1 (yi − ybi)
2/N
(1)
where ybi denotes the predicted value for the i-th example.
In this work, the Mathematics and Portuguese grades
(i.e. G3 of Table 1) will be modeled using three supervised approaches:
1. Binary classification – pass if G3≥10, else fail;
2. 5-Level classification – based on the Erasmus1
grade conversion system (Table 2);
3. Regression – the G3 value (numeric output between 0 and 20).
Figure 1 plots the respective histograms.
Several DM algorithms, each one with its own purposes
and capabilities, have been proposed for classification
and regression tasks. The Decision Tree (DT) is a

in 31 countries.

branching structure that represents a set of rules, distinguishing values in a hierarchical form (Breiman et al.
1984). This representation can translated into a set of
IF-THEN rules, which are easy to understand by humans. The Random Forest (RF) (Breiman 2001) is an
ensemble of T unpruned DT. Each tree is based in a random feature selection from bootstrap training samples
and the RF predictions are built by averaging the outputs of the T trees. The RF is more difficult to interpret
when compared with the single DT, although it is still
possible to provide explanatory knowledge in terms of
its input variable relevance. Nonlinear functions, such
as Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines
(SVM), have also been proposed for DM tasks (Hastie
et al. 2001), obtaining better results when a high nonlinearity is present. In this work, the NN model is based
in the popular multilayer perceptron, with one hidden
layer with H hidden nodes, while the SVM will use a
gaussian kernel with one hyperparameter (γ). It should
be noted that NN and SVM use model representations
that are difficult to understand by humans. Also, NN
and SVM are more affected by irrelevant inputs than
the DT/RF algorithms, since the latter explicitly perform an internal feature selection.
Computational Environment
All experiments reported in this study were conducted
using the RMiner (Cortez In press), an open source
library for the R environment that facilitates the use of
DM techniques (Figure 2). R is a free and high-level
matrix programming language with a powerful suite of
tools for statistical and data analysis (R Development
Core Team 2006). It can run in multiple platforms (e.g.
Windows, MacOS or Linux) and new features can be
added by creating packages.
The RMiner library2 presents a set of coherent functions (e.g. mining, saveMining) for classification and
regression tasks (Cortez In press). In particular, the library uses the rpart (DT), randomForest (RF), nnet
(NN) and kernlab (SVM) packages. As an example,
the following RMiner/R code was used during the DT
predictive experiments of the portuguese binary classi2http://www.dsi.uminho.pt/˜pcortez/R/rminer.zip

RESULTS
Predictive Performance
Before fitting the models, some preprocessing was required by the NN and SVM models. The nominal3 variables (e.g Mjob) were transformed into a 1-of-C encoding and all attributes were standardized to a zero
mean and one standard deviation (Hastie et al. 2001).
Next, the DM models were fitted. The DT node split
was adjusted for the reduction of the sum of squares.
Regarding the remaining methods, the default parameters were adopted for the RF (e.g. T = 500), NN (e.g.
E = 100 epochs of the BFGS algorithm) and SVM (e.g.
Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithm). Also, the
NN and SVM hyperparameters were optimized using an
internal grid search (i.e. using only training data) where
H ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} and γ ∈ {2
−9
, 2
−7
, 2
−5
, 2
−3
, 2
−1}.
Since we suspected that the G1 and G2 grades would
have a high impact, three input configurations were
tested for each DM model:
• A - with all variables from Table 1 except G3 (the
output);
• B - similar to A but without G2 (the second period
grade); and
• C - similar to B but without G1 (the first period
grade).
3Discrete with more than two non-ordered values.
To access the predictive performances, 20 runs of a 10-
fold cross-validation (Hastie et al. 2001) (in a total of 200
simulations) were applied to each configuration. Under
such scheme, for a given run the data is randomly divided in 10 subsets of equal size. Sequentially, one different subset is tested (with 10% of the data) and the
remaining data used to fit the DM technique. At the
end of this process, the evaluated test set contains the
whole dataset, although 10 variations of the same DM
model are used to create the predictions.
As a baseline comparison, a naive predictor (NV) will
also be tested. For the A setup, this model is equal
to the second period grade (G2 or its binary/5-level
versions). When the second grade is not available (B
setup), the first period grade is used (or its binary/5-
level variants). If no evaluation is present (C setup)
then the most common class (for classification tasks) or
the average output value (regression) is returned.
The test set results are shown in Tables 3 to 5 in terms
of the mean and respective t-student 95% confidence intervals (Flexer 1996). As expected, the A setup achieves
the best results. The predictive performance decreases
when the second period grade is not known (B) and
the wost results are obtained when no student scores
are used (C). Using only the last available evaluation
(NV method for the first two input setups) is the best
option for the Mathematics classification goals (both binary and 5-level) and Portuguese regression under the
A input selection. This suggests that in these cases the
non evaluation inputs are of no use. However, the scenario changes for the remaining experiments. The RF
is the best choice in 8 cases, followed by the DT, which
obtains 4 best results. In general, the nonlinear function methods (NN and SVM) are outperformed by the
tree based ones. This behavior may be explained by a
high number of irrelevant inputs, as shown in the next
section.
As an example of the quality of the predictions, Figure 3
shows the confusion matrices for the DT algorithm, Portuguese class and A setup. In both binary and 5-level
classification, the majority of the values are in/near the
matrix diagonal, revealing a good fit. The figure also
presents the RF scatter plot (predicted versus the observed values) for the Mathematics regression approach.
The RF predictions are close to the diagonal line (which
denotes the perfect forecast) within most of the output
range (i.e. [5, 20]).
Descriptive Knowledge
Here the goal is not to infer about the predictive capabilities of each model, as measured in the previous section,
but to give a simple description that summarizes the
best DM models. Thus, the whole dataset will be used
in the descriptive experiments. Furthermore, only the
DT/RF algorithms will be considered, since it is more
easy to extract knowledge from these models and they
achieved in general the best predictive performances.
Table 6 presents the relative importance (in percentage)
of each input variable as measured by the RF algorithm
(Breiman 2001). To clarify the analysis, only the five
most relevant results are shown in the table. These five
variables present an overall impact that ranges from 43%
to 77%, which indicates that there is a high number of
irrelevant inputs. As expected, the student evaluations
have a high impact (from 23% to 46%) in the models.
For instance, G2 is the most important feature for the A
input selection example, while G1 is highly relevant for
the B setup. Also, the number of past failures, which is
related with previous student performance, is the most
important factor when no student scores are available.
Nevertheless, there are other relevant factors, such as
school related (e.g. number of absences, extra school
support or travel time), demographic (e.g. the mother’s
job) and social (e.g. going out with friends, alcohol consumption) variables.
Figure 4 plots the best four DT. Again, the student
grades are the most relevant features, appearing at the
root of the trees, and only a small number (2 to 5) of the
inputs considered are used. There are some interesting
rules that can be extracted from these trees, for instance:
1. if G1< 10 ∧ G2=9 ∧ Mjob ∈ {teacher, other} then
pass;
2. if G1< 10 ∧ G2=9 ∧ Mjob ∈ {home, health, civil
services} then fail;
3. if 12 ≤G2< 14 ∧ goout> 1 then III;
4. if 12 ≤G2< 14 ∧ goout= 1 then II;
5. if 11 <G1≤ 13 ∧ absences< 7 then 13;
6. if 11 <G1≤ 13 ∧ absences≥ 7 then 11;
These rules show the influence of the mother’s job (rules
1–2), going out with friends (rules 3–4) and the number
of absences (rules 5–6).
CONCLUSIONS
Education is a crucial element in our society. Business
Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM) techniques, which
allow a high level extraction of knowledge from raw data,
offer interesting possibilities for the education domain.
In particular, several studies have used BI/DM methods
to improve the quality of education and enhance school
resource management.
In this paper, we have addressed the prediction of secondary student grades of two core classes (Mathematics
and Portuguese) by using past school grades (first and
second periods), demographic, social and other school
related data. Three different DM goals (i.e. binary/5-
level classification and regression) and four DM methods, i.e. Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF),
Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines
(SVM), were tested. Also, distinct input selections (e.g.
with or without past grades) were explored. The obtained results reveal that it is possible to achieve a high
predictive accuracy, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are known. This confirms the
conclusion found in (Kotsiantis et al. 2004): student
achievement is highly affected by previous performances.
Nevertheless, an analysis to knowledge provided by the
best predictive models has shown that, in some cases,
there are other relevant features, such as: school related
(e.g. number of absences, reason to choose school, extra educational school support), demographic (e.g. student’s age, parent’s job and education) and social (e.g.
going out with friends, alcohol consumption) variables.
This study was based on an off-line learning, since the
DM techniques were applied after the data was collected.
However, there is a potential for an automatic on-line
learning environment, by using a student prediction engine as part of a school management support system.
This will allow the collection of additional features (e.g.
grades from previous school years) and also to obtain
a valuable feedback from the school professionals. Furthermore, we intent to enlarge the experiments to more
schools and school years, in order to enrich the student
databases. Automatic feature selection methods (e.g.
filtering or wrapper) (Witten and Frank 2005) will also
be explored, since only a small portion of the input variables considered seem to be relevant. In particular, this
is expected to benefit the nonlinear function methods
(e.g. NN and SVM), which are more sensitive to irrelevant inputs. More research is also needed (e.g. sociological studies) in order to understand why and how some
variables (e.g. reason to choose school, parent’s job or
alcohol consumption) affect student performance.

   - The data is then split into training and testing sets.
   - The regression model is trained on the training set using the features listed above.
   - The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

5. **Evaluation**:
   The trained model is evaluated to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data. The evaluation metrics help in understanding the model's accuracy and areas for improvement.

This process ensures that the model can predict students' final grades based on their demographics, family background, and other factors.
